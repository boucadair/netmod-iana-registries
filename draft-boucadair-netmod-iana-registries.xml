    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a set of guidelines for YANG module authors
      related to the design of IANA-maintained modules. These guidelines are
      meant to leverage existing IANA registries and use YANG as just another
      format to present the content of these registries.</t>

      <t>This document updates RFC 8407 by providing additional guidelines for
      IANA-maintained modules. It does not change anything written in RFC
      8407. </t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>IANA maintains a set of registries that are key for interoperability.
      The content of these registries are usually available using various
      formats (e.g., plain text, XML). However, there were some confusion in
      the past about whether the content of some registries is dependent on a
      specific representation format. For example, Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC8892"></xref> was published to clarify that MIB and YANG
      modules are merely additional formats in which the "Interface Types
      (ifType)" and "Tunnel Types (tunnelType)" registries are available. The
      MIB <xref target="RFC2863"></xref> and YANG modules <xref
      target="RFC7224"></xref><xref target="RFC8675"></xref> are not separate
      registries, and the same values are always present in all formats of the
      same registry.</t>

      <t>Also, some YANG modules include parameters and values directly in a
      module that is not maintained by IANA while these are populated in an
      IANA registry. Such a design is suboptimal as it creates another source
      of information that may deviate from the IANA registry as new values are
      assigned.</t>

      <t>For the sake of consistency, better flexibility to support new
      values, and maintaining IANA registries as the unique authoritative
      source of information, when such an information is maintained in a
      registry, this document encourages the use of IANA-maintained
      modules.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 2 of <xref

    <section anchor="update" title="Guidelines for IANA-Maintained Registries">
      <t>When designing a YANG module for a functionality governed by a
      protocol for which IANA maintains a registry, it is RECOMMENDED to
      specify an IANA-maintained module that echoes the content of that
      registry. This is superior to including them as part of an
      IETF-maintained module. </t>

      <t>When one or multiple sub-registries are available under the same
      registry, it is RECOMMENDED to define an IANA-maintained module for each
      sub-registry. However, module designers MAY consider defining one single
      IANA-maintained module that covers all sub-registries if maintaining
      that single module is manageable (e.g., very few values are present or
      expected to be present for each sub-registry). An example of such a
      module is documented in Section 5.2 of <xref
      target="RFC9132"></xref>.</t>

      <t>An IANA-maintained module MAY use identities (e.g., <xref
      target="RFC8675"></xref>) or enumerations (e.g., <xref
      target="RFC9108"></xref>). The final decision is left to the module
      designers and should be made based upon specifics related to the
      intended use of the module. It is worth mentioning that identities are
      useful if the registry entries are organized hierarchically, possibly
      including multiple inheritances. It is RECOMMENDED that the reasoning
      for the design choice is documented in the companion specification
      document that registers the module. For example, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry"></xref> defines an IANA-maintained
      module that uses enumerations for the following reason:</t>

      <t><figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[  "The DOTS telemetry module (Section 10.1) uses "enumerations" rather
   than "identities" to define units, samples, and intervals because
   otherwise the namespace identifier "ietf-dots-telemetry" must be
   included when a telemetry attribute is included (e.g., in a
   mitigation efficacy update).  The use of "identities" is thus
   suboptimal from a message compactness standpoint; one of the key
   requirements for DOTS messages."]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>Designers of IANA-maintained modules MAY supply the full Initial
      version of the module in a specification document that registers the
      module or only a script to be used (including by IANA) for generating
      the module (e.g., an XSLT stylesheet as in Appendix A of <xref
      target="RFC9108"></xref>). When a script is used, the Internet-Draft
      that defines an IANA-maintained module SHOULD include an appendix with
      the initial full version of the module. Including such an appendix in
      pre-RFC versions is meant to assess the correctness of the outcome of
      the supplied script. The authors MUST include a note to the RFC Editor
      requesting that the appendix be removed before publication as RFC.
      Publishing initial versions of IANA-maintained modules in RFCs may be
      misused by some implementers despite the appropriate language to refer
      to the IANA registry to retrieve the up-to-date module.<list
          style="empty">
          <t>Note: <xref target="Style"></xref> provides XSLT 1.0 stylesheets
          and other tools for translating IANA registries to YANG modules. The
          tools can be used to generate up-to-date revisions of an
          IANA-maintained module based upon the XML representation of an IANA
          registry.</t>
