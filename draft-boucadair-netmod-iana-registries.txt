       Recommendations for Creating IANA-Maintained YANG Modules
               draft-boucadair-netmod-iana-registries-02

Abstract

   This document provides a set of guidelines for YANG module authors
   related to the design of IANA-maintained modules.  These guidelines
   are meant to leverage existing IANA registries and use YANG as just
   another format to present the content of these registries.

   This document updates RFC 8407 by providing additional guidelines for
   IANA-maintained modules.  It does not change anything written in RFC
   8407.

1.  Introduction

   IANA maintains a set of registries that are key for interoperability.
   The content of these registries are usually available using various
   formats (e.g., plain text, XML).  However, there were some confusion
   in the past about whether the content of some registries is dependent
   on a specific representation format.  For example, Section 5 of
   [RFC8892] was published to clarify that MIB and YANG modules are
   merely additional formats in which the "Interface Types (ifType)" and
   "Tunnel Types (tunnelType)" registries are available.  The MIB
   [RFC2863] and YANG modules [RFC7224][RFC8675] are not separate
   registries, and the same values are always present in all formats of
   the same registry.

   Also, some YANG modules include parameters and values directly in a
   module that is not maintained by IANA while these are populated in an
   IANA registry.  Such a design is suboptimal as it creates another
   source of information that may deviate from the IANA registry as new
   values are assigned.

   For the sake of consistency, better flexibility to support new
   values, and maintaining IANA registries as the unique authoritative
   source of information, when such an information is maintained in a
   registry, this document encourages the use of IANA-maintained
   modules.

   Section 3 updates the guidelines in [RFC8407].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC8407].

3.  Guidelines for IANA-Maintained Registries

   When designing a YANG module for a functionality governed by a
   protocol for which IANA maintains a registry, it is RECOMMENDED to
   specify an IANA-maintained module that echoes the content of that
   registry.  This is superior to including them as part of an IETF-
   maintained module.

   When one or multiple sub-registries are available under the same
   registry, it is RECOMMENDED to define an IANA-maintained module for
   each sub-registry.  However, module designers MAY consider defining
   one single IANA-maintained module that covers all sub-registries if
   maintaining that single module is manageable (e.g., very few values
   are present or expected to be present for each sub-registry).  An
   example of such a module is documented in Section 5.2 of [RFC9132].

   An IANA-maintained module MAY use identities (e.g., [RFC8675]) or
   enumerations (e.g., [RFC9108]).  The final decision is left to the
   module designers and should be made based upon specifics related to
   the intended use of the module.  It is worth mentioning that
   identities are useful if the registry entries are organized
   hierarchically, possibly including multiple inheritances.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the reasoning for the design choice is documented in
   the companion specification document that registers the module.  For
   example, [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry] defines an IANA-maintained module
   that uses enumerations for the following reason:

    "The DOTS telemetry module (Section 10.1) uses "enumerations" rather
     than "identities" to define units, samples, and intervals because
     otherwise the namespace identifier "ietf-dots-telemetry" must be
     included when a telemetry attribute is included (e.g., in a
     mitigation efficacy update).  The use of "identities" is thus
     suboptimal from a message compactness standpoint; one of the key
     requirements for DOTS messages."

   Designers of IANA-maintained modules MAY supply the full Initial
   version of the module in a specification document that registers the
   module or only a script to be used (including by IANA) for generating
   the module (e.g., an XSLT stylesheet as in Appendix A of [RFC9108]).
   When a script is used, the Internet-Draft that defines an IANA-
   maintained module SHOULD include an appendix with the initial full
   version of the module.  Including such an appendix in pre-RFC
   versions is meant to assess the correctness of the outcome of the
   supplied script.  The authors MUST include a note to the RFC Editor
   requesting that the appendix be removed before publication as RFC.
   Publishing initial versions of IANA-maintained modules in RFCs may be
   misused by some implementers despite the appropriate language to
   refer to the IANA registry to retrieve the up-to-date module.

      Note: [Style] provides XSLT 1.0 stylesheets and other tools for
      translating IANA registries to YANG modules.  The tools can be
      used to generate up-to-date revisions of an IANA-maintained module
      based upon the XML representation of an IANA registry.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new concerns other than those
   already discussed in Section 15 of [RFC8407].

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document is triggered by a discussion the author had with Dhruv
   Dhody and Jensen Zhang.
