    <abstract>
      <t>The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various
      options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS,
      DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-QUIC). Particularly, this document is meant to
      exemplify how Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) and
      Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) can be used in typical
      deployment contexts. Also, the document includes considerations related
      to hosting a DNS forwarder in local networks.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> specifies how a local encrypted DNS
      resolver can be discovered by connected hosts by means of DHCP <xref
      target="RFC2132"></xref>, DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"></xref>, and
      IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) <xref target="RFC4861"></xref> options.
      These options are designed to convey the following information: the DNS
      Authentication Domain Name (ADN), a list of IP addresses, and a set of
      service parameters. The ADN is used as a reference identifier for
      authentication purposes, while the list of IP addresses designate where
      to locate the resolver without relying upon an external resolver. The
      service parameters provide additional information to characterize a DNS
      resolver (e.g., supported encrypted DNS, customized DNS port number, or
      URI Template for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)). Such an information is used by a
      DNS client for DNS resolver selection and session establishment.</t>

      <t>This document discusses some deployment considerations for the
      discovery of encrypted DNS resolvers such as DoH <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref>, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref>, or DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) <xref
      target="RFC9250"></xref> in local networks.</t>

      <t>Sample target deployment scenarios are discussed in <xref
      target="depl"></xref>; both managed and unmanaged Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPEs) are covered. It is out of the scope of this document to
      provide an exhaustive inventory of deployments where Encrypted DNS
      options can be used.</t>

      <t>Considerations related to hosting a DNS forwarder in a local network
      are described in <xref target="forwarder"></xref>. In contexts where
      CPEs can't be upgraded to support DNR, Discovery of Designated Resolvers
      (DDR) <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-ddr"></xref> can be used. See <xref
      target="legacy"></xref> for more details.</t>

      <t>Techniques, such as the one defined in <xref
      target="I-D.boucadair-opsawg-add-encrypted-dns"></xref>, can be enabled
      together with <xref target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref> to feed the
      Encrypted DNS options. However, the document does not make any
      assumption about the internal behavior at the network side to feed the
      Encrypted DNS options that are supplied to requesting hosts; only the
      external observed behavior is detailed in the following sections.</t>

      <t>Policies to guide the activation and selection of encrypted DNS can
      be configured by users using implementation specific means (e.g., CPE
      management interface). </t>

        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="depl" title="Sample Target Deployment Scenarios">
      <t>ISPs usually provide DNS resolvers to their customers. To that aim,
      ISPs deploy the following mechanisms to advertise a list of DNS
      Recursive DNS server(s) to their customers:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Protocol Configuration Options in cellular networks <xref
          target="TS.24008"></xref>.</t>

          <t>DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2132"></xref> (Domain Name Server Option)
          or DHCPv6 <xref target="RFC8415"></xref><xref
          target="RFC3646"></xref> (OPTION_DNS_SERVERS).</t>

          <t>IPv6 Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"></xref><xref
          target="RFC8106"></xref> (Type 25 (Recursive DNS Server
          Option)).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The communication between a customer's device (possibly via a CPE)
      and an ISP-supplied DNS resolver takes place by using cleartext DNS
      messages (Do53). Some examples are depicted in cases (a) and (c) of
      <xref target="do53"></xref>. In the case of cellular networks, the
      cellular network will provide connectivity directly to a host (e.g.,
      smartphone, tablet) or via a CPE. Do53 mechanisms used within the Local
      Area Network (LAN) are similar in both fixed and cellular CPE-based
      broadband service offerings.</t>

      <t>Some ISPs rely upon external resolvers (e.g., outsourced service or
      public resolvers); these ISPs provide their customers with the IP
      addresses of these external DNS resolvers. An example is depicted in
      cases (b) and (d) of <xref target="do53"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The IP addresses of the DNS resolver can also be configured on CPEs
      using dedicated management tools. As such, users can modify the default
      DNS configuration of their CPEs (e.g., supplied by their ISP) to
      configure their favorite DNS servers. This document permits such
      deployments.</t>

        <t>This section focuses on CPEs that are managed by ISPs.</t>

        <section title="Direct DNS">
          <t>ISPs have developed an expertise in managing service-specific
          configuration information (e.g., CPE WAN Management Protocol <xref
          target="TR-069"></xref>). For example, these tools may be used to
          provision the DNS server's ADN and additional service parameters to
          managed CPEs if an encrypted DNS is supported by a network similar
          to what is depicted in <xref target="wan"></xref>.</t>

          <t>For example, DoH-capable DNS clients establish the DoH session
          with the discovered DoH server.</t>

          <t>The DNS client discovers whether the network-designated DNS
          resolver supports a given encrypted DNS scheme (e.g., DoT or DoH) by
          using the "alpn" service parameter (<xref section="3.1.5"

          relays the list of encrypted DNS resolvers it learns from the
          network by using, e.g., DNR. Direct encrypted DNS sessions will be

          <t>For all the cases shown in <xref target="proxied"></xref>, the
          CPE advertises itself as the default DNS server to the hosts it
          serves in the LAN. The CPE relies upon DHCP or RA to advertise
          itself to internal hosts as the default encrypted DNS (cases (a) and
          (c)) or Do53 resolver (cases (b) and (d)). When receiving a DNS
          request it cannot handle locally, the CPE forwards the request to an
          upstream encrypted DNS. The upstream encrypted DNS can be hosted by
          the ISP (cases (a) and (b)) or provided by a third party (cases (c)
          and (d)).</t>

          <t>Such a forwarder deployment is required for IPv4 service
          continuity purposes (e.g., Section 5.4.1 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-rfc7084-bis"></xref>) or for supporting
          advanced services within a local network (e.g., malware filtering,
          parental control, Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) <xref
          target="RFC8520"></xref> to only allow intended communications to
          and from an IoT device). When the CPE behaves as a DNS forwarder,
          DNS communications can be decomposed into two legs:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>The leg between an internal host and the CPE.</t>

              <t>The leg between the CPE and an upstream DNS resolver.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>An ISP that offers encrypted DNS to its customers may enable
          encrypted DNS in one or both legs as shown in <xref
          target="proxied"></xref>. Additional considerations related to this
          deployment are discussed in <xref target="forwarder"></xref>.</t>

          <t>Customers may decide to deploy unmanaged CPEs (assuming the CPE
          is compliant with the network access technical specification that is
          usually published by ISPs). Upon attachment to the network, an
          unmanaged CPE receives from the network its service configuration
          (including the network-designated DNS information) by means of,
          e.g., DHCP. That DNS information is shared within the LAN following
          the same mechanisms as those discussed in <xref
          target="mcpe"></xref>. A host can then establish encrypted DNS
          sessions with encrypted DNS resolvers similar to what is depicted in

          <t>Absent any explicit configuration on the internal CPE to override

          Internal CPE relays the DNS information it receives via DHCP/RA from
          the ISP-supplied CPE to connected hosts. Encrypted DNS sessions can
          be established by a host with the DNS resolvers that are supplied by

             title="Hosting Encrypted DNS Forwarder in Local Networks">
      <t>This section discusses some deployment considerations to host an
      encrypted DNS forwarder within a local network.</t>

      <section anchor="forwarder_m" title="Managed CPEs">
        <t>The section discusses mechanisms that can be used to host an
        encrypted DNS forwarder in a managed CPE (<xref
        target="mcpe"></xref>).</t>

        <section title="DNS Forwarders">
          <t>The managed CPE should support a configuration parameter to
          instruct the CPE whether it has to relay the encrypted DNS resolver
          received from the ISP's network or has to announce itself as a
          forwarder within the local network. The default behavior of the CPE
          is to supply the encrypted DNS resolver received from the ISP's
          network.</t>
        </section>

        <section anchor="acme" title="ACME">
          <t>The ISP can assign a unique FQDN (e.g., "cpe1.example.com") and a
          domain-validated public certificate to the encrypted DNS forwarder
          hosted on the CPE.</t>

          <t>Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) <xref
          target="RFC8555"></xref> can be used by the ISP to automate
          certificate management functions such as domain validation
          procedure, certificate issuance, and certificate revocation.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="forwarder_u" title="Unmanaged CPEs">
        <t>The approach specified in <xref target="forwarder_m"></xref> does
        not apply for hosting a DNS forwarder in an unmanaged CPE.</t>

        <t>The unmanaged CPE administrator can host an encrypted DNS forwarder
        on the unmanaged CPE. This assumes the following:<list style="symbols">
            <t>The encrypted DNS resolver certificate is managed by the entity
            in-charge of hosting the encrypted DNS forwarder. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />Alternatively, a security service provider can
            assign a unique FQDN to the CPE. The encrypted DNS forwarder will
            act like a private encrypted DNS resolver only be accessible from
            within the local network.</t>

            <t>The encrypted DNS forwarder will either be configured to use
            the ISP's or a 3rd party encrypted DNS resolver.</t>

            <t>The unmanaged CPE will advertise the encrypted DNS forwarder
            ADN using DHCP/RA to internal hosts as per <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-add-dnr"></xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><xref target="internal_forwarded"></xref> illustrates an example of
        an unmanaged CPE hosting a forwarder which connects to a 3rd party
        encrypted DNS resolver. In this example, the DNS information received
        from the managed CPE (and therefore from the ISP) is ignored by the
        Internal CPE hosting the forwarder. The internal CPE may support a
        mechanism (e.g., <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-add-split-horizon-authority"></xref>) to resolve
        split-horizon domains (e.g., provider's private name discussed in
        <xref section="2" target="RFC6731"></xref>).</t>

        <t>An unmanaged CPE can be used to host an encrypted DNS forwarder
        even if the managed CPE does not support DNR. In the example depicted
        in <xref target="internal_forwarded2"></xref>, the ISP uses DHCP to
        provision Do53 resolvers to managed CPEs, while DNR is enabled between
        the internal CPE and the hosts it services. The internal CPE ignores
        the DNS configuration that it receives from the managed CPE.</t>
